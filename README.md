# solar-logger

This is a code for an esp32 with a LC12S to replace a DataBox24G from All of Solar, which communicates with a solar inverter to save statistics.

All configuration is in `/include/config-example.h` just change the values to your needs and rename it to `config.h`.

For more information on how the hardware works and how I did the reverse engineering visit the hackaday project [here](https://hackaday.io/project/186606-solar-inverter-datalogger-improvements).

If anyone is interested in a complete PCB with LC12S and ESP32 for easy communication with the panel and integration into any smarthome system feel free to contact me.
